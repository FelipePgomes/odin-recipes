            <p class="text-p">Doughnuts, in some way, shape, or form, pop up in many cultures around
                the world. At their essence, this treat is basically sweet dough that is deep-fried 
                or, in some cases, baked.</p>

            <p class="text-p">These Brazilian doughnuts, also known as bolinhos
                de chuva, are named for their raindrop shape. Some liken them to 
                beignets. As you drop spoonfuls of batter into the oil, little 
                peaks form, which become delicious crunchy bits on the outside 
                of the doughnut. These cinnamon sugar doughnuts are very easy 
                and quick to make, perfect for a weekend breakfast, and are also
                sometimes served with tea.<br>
                You'll need a thermometer that's suitable for deep frying to make
                sure the oil reaches the desired temperatureâ€”and stays there. Otherwise,
                the doughnuts may burn or fry unevenly. Be prepared to work quickly, too,
                as the doughnuts are small and only take a few minutes to fry.</p>

                    <li class="ingredients">Gather the ingredients.</li>
                    <li class="ingredients">In a deep fryer or skillet, heat several inches of vegetable oil to 360 F.</li>
                    <li class="ingredients">In a small bowl, stir the cinnamon into 1/2 cup sugar and set aside.</li>
                    <li class="ingredients">In another bowl, mix together the flour, salt, and 3 tablespoons sugar.</li>
                    <li class="ingredients">Stir in the eggs and 1/2 cup buttermilk with a wooden spoon. Add more buttermilk, slowly, until mixture has the consistency of a very thick cake batter.</li>
                    <li class="ingredients">Stir in the baking powder.</li>
                    <li class="ingredients">Using two teaspoons (or a small cookie scoop), scoop a generous teaspoon of batter and carefully drop it into the oil, using the second spoon to help scrape the dough off of the first one.</li>
                    <li class="ingredients">Repeat with several more teaspoons, but do not overcrowd the doughnuts or they will stick together.</li>
                    <li class="ingredients">Cook the doughnuts, turning occasionally, until golden brown on all sides.</li>
                    <li class="ingredients">Remove doughnuts from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain briefly on paper towels.</li>
                    <li class="ingredients">SRoll the doughnuts in the cinnamon sugar while still hot.</li>
                    <li class="ingredients">Cook the rest of the doughnuts in batches.</li>
                    <li class="ingredients">Serve and enjoy!</li>
