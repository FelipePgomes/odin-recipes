                <p class="text-p">Feijoada is a hearty black bean stew recipe made 
                    with meat, black beans, garlic, and tomatoes, and it's the 
                    national dish of Brazil. Served over rice, it’s a filling meal 
                    to warm you up on a chilly winter day. It also pairs well with 
                    collard greens!</p>

                <p class="text-p">Feijoada has as many versions as there are cooks, 
                    but in Brazil, it almost always has black beans and always has a 
                    mixture of salted, smoked, and fresh meats. Some versions are a 
                    little spicy from the sausages, others totally mild. Some people's 
                    feijoada are thick "eat-it-with-a-fork" versions, others, like this one,
                    are more like a traditional stew. Either way, it's traditional to serve
                    this stew with white rice and maybe some sautéed collard greens.

                    <h2 class="title-ingredients"> Steps to Make It</h2>
                    <h3 class="prep">Method</h3>
                
                    <ol>
                        <li class="ingredients">Soak the beans in hot water:
                            Pour boiling water over the black beans and let them sit while you prepare the rest of the stew.</li>
                        <li class="ingredients">Brown the pork shoulder:
                            Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat and brown the pork shoulder. When the meat has browned, remove the meat from the pot, set aside.</li>
                        <li class="ingredients">Brown the onions and add garlic:
                            Add the onions to the pot. Brown them, stirring occasionally, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.
                            
                            Sprinkle a little salt over the onions and add the garlic. Stir well and sauté 2 more minutes.</li>
                        <li class="ingredients">Add the meat, bay leaves, and water:
                            Add back the pork shoulder and the other meats. Add enough water to cover all ingredients. Add the bay leaves, cover, and bring to a simmer. Cook gently for 1 hour.</li>
                        <li class="ingredients">Add the soaked black beans:
                            Drain the black beans from their soaking liquid and add them to the stew. Simmer gently, covered, until the beans are tender, about an hour and a half.</li>
                        <li class="ingredients">Add the tomatoes:
                            Add the tomatoes, stir well and taste for salt, adding if it's needed. Simmer this, uncovered, until the meat begins to fall off the ham hock, which will probably take 2 to 3 hours.
                            
                            Serve with white rice and hot sauce. A classic side dish would be sautéed collard greens.</li>
